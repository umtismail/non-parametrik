**Explanation:**

This R script performs data analysis on two different datasets, one with independent variables and one with dependent variables. The script is [LENGTH] lines long.

**Datasets:**

* Independent Variables: fixed_acidity_samples.csv
* Dependent Variables: exams.csv

* Independent Variables:
  * Summary statistics (summary)
  * Normality test (Shapiro-Wilk test)
  * Histogram plotting
  * Normal QQ plot
  * Boxplot plotting (ggplot2)
  * Wilcoxon signed-rank test by median
  * Kruskal-Wallis test
* Dependent Variables:
  * Summary statistics (summary)
  * Normality test (Shapiro-Wilk test)
  * Histogram plotting
  * Normal QQ plot
  * Boxplot plotting (ggplot2)
  * Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (math-reading, math-writing, reading-writing)
  * Friedman test
  * Dunn test
* Additional: Mann-Kendall trend analysis for independent variables (Kitap1.xlsx - Minimum temperature averages)

**Required Libraries::**

* read.csv
* summary
* shapiro.test
* hist
*  qqPlot
*  ggplot
*  DescTools
* stats
